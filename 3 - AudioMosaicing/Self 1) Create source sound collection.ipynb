The collection of sounds is created by defining a number of queries to be performed using the Freesound API and concatenanting the results of each query. A number of metadata fields are stored for each sound in the collection and saved into a Pandas DataFrame object and CSV file in disk. For each sound in the collection, we also download an OGG preview and store it in disk.\n","\n","This notebook uses the `freesound` Python package for interacting with the Freesound API. The source code for this package can be found here: https://github.com/mtg/freesound-python. In this repository you'll find a Python script with [examples](https://github.com/MTG/freesound-python/blob/master/examples.py) to learn how to interact with the API. Nevertheless, if you are further interested in the Freesound API, check the [API documentation](http://freesound.org/docs/api/) which provides more information.\n","\n","**NOTE**: A Freesound API key is provided in this notebook, but you should make a Freesound account and get your own key. You can get a key here: https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":223842,"status":"ok","timestamp":1680176594923,"user":{"displayName":"THOMAS LE ROUX","userId":"04065189461372878793"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"jtVrSfz-bmGX","outputId":"bca61cfb-f821-444b-d9f2-f1e60ec81fe4"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting essentia\n","  Downloading essentia-2.1b6.dev858-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (13.7 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m13.7/13.7 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m61.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.8.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from essentia) (1.22.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from essentia) (1.16.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from essentia) (6.0)\n","Installing collected packages: essentia\n","Successfully installed essentia-2.1b6.dev858\n","Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting git+https://github.com/mtg/freesound-python.git\n","  Cloning https://github.com/mtg/freesound-python.git to /tmp/pip-req-build-zk9ifthj\n","  Running command git clone --filter=blob:none --quiet https://github.com/mtg/freesound-python.git /tmp/pip-req-build-zk9ifthj\n","  Resolved https://github.com/mtg/freesound-python.git to commit 14f2e6d35587181fb376f36fb2cfab4941c05b15\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests<3.0,>2.27 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from freesound-python==1.1) (2.27.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<1.27,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from requests<3.0,>2.27->freesound-python==1.1) (1.26.15)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer~=2.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from requests<3.0,>2.27->freesound-python==1.1) (2.0.12)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from requests<3.0,>2.27->freesound-python==1.1) (2022.12.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from requests<3.0,>2.27->freesound-python==1.1) (3.4)\n","Building wheels for collected packages: freesound-python\n","  Building wheel for freesound-python (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for freesound-python: filename=freesound_python-1.1-py3-none-any.whl size=6443 sha256=6e446817101237879027e7a1bcdfdfd41c179e7fb0fa97ae6362cb1c97db2606\n","  Stored in directory: /tmp/pip-ephem-wheel-cache-knry203e/wheels/0e/40/c2/8769649bfe986e312e67c9fd16cfcca06fd386442f6f6ef45b\n","Successfully built freesound-python\n","Installing collected packages: freesound-python\n","Successfully installed freesound-python-1.1\n","Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["# Essentia\n","!pip install essentia\n","# Freesound-python\n","!pip install git+https://github.com/mtg/freesound-python.git\n","# Mount drive and cd to notebook folder\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":222,"status":"ok","timestamp":1680182555253,"user":{"displayName":"THOMAS LE ROUX","userId":"04065189461372878793"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"V9b0q-omlYfk","outputId":"60038005-b17e-4cb8-a19c-988d04b00686"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/Term2/ASMLab/Freesound/Self work\n"]}],"source":["%cd '/content/drive/MyDrive/Term2/ASMLab/Freesound/Self work'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":401,"status":"ok","timestamp":1680184579804,"user":{"displayName":"THOMAS LE ROUX","userId":"04065189461372878793"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"hDtc6J4-bk1m"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import freesound\n","from IPython.display import display\n","\n","FREESOUND_API_KEY = ''  # Please replace by your own Freesound API key\n","FILES_DIR = 'files'  # Place where to store the downloaded diles.
